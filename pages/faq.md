# FAQ

#### Who are you?

We are Belgian entrepreneurs who try to change the world one electron at a time. Together, we pitched hundreds of Angel Investors and Venture Capitalists in Belgium and in the States. We've tried and failed many times until we eventually got it right. We've learned a ton of things along the way that could be useful to others. We want to share our experience to inspire and help new entrepreneurs to also take on this journey.

#### Why?
We couldn't have achieved a quarter of what we achieved without the help of other entrepreneurs at every step of the way.  This is our way to pay it forward.

#### How?
By making ourselves available for one to one meetings with entrepreneurs (Skype calls or in person coffee or office hour), or one to many conversations (through interviews or conferences). 

We already individually do office hours, conferences, interviews and so on. It's never easy to organize because we are quite busy and we are only a few weeks per year in Belgium. So we wanted to create a website to scale these activities and make it easier both for you and for us to get in touch and be notified whenever we have availabilities for any of those activities.

#### Who is this for?
Primarily entrepreneurs, but also conference organizers, and journalists who want to spread the entrepreneurial virus.

#### How can you help me?
First, we can share our story. If we could do what we did, there is no reason why you couldn't do 10x better. Honestly. Especially if you don't repeat the same mistakes that we've made.

Beyond that, we can help you on product design, go-to-market strategy, how to get your first users, get traction and scale up to millions. 

We can also help you in your fundraising efforts and introduce you to other nice folks who could help you as well.

Lastly, we can also help you move to the States if your project requires it.

#### Which entrepreneur should I pick?
Every one of us has a different story and experience in different industries. Pick the entrepreneur that has the experience that is the most relevant to your project.

#### How much does it cost?
- Skype call: nada
- Coffee: depends if you take a regular coffee or a cappuccino 
- Office hour: nada
- Lunch: happy to go to Quick or In&Out, whatever your budget is
- Conference: if we are in town and are available, free (unless you are the European Commission). Otherwise, we ask you to cover our flight from San Francisco and accommodation. Classic stuff. Depending on your budget, we like the business class because it's a long flight and if we can't sleep we look wasted when we land. 

#### How can I thank you?
Don't. Just pay forward. 

#### What's the catch?
There isn't except that we are quite busy people so our availabilities are limited. 

#### Are you going to add more entrepreneurs to your group?
We would love to. If you are an entrepreneur and believe that your experience and your connections can help other fellow entrepreneurs, get in touch. Pro tip: get introduced.

#### Do you have a political agenda?
Yes, we told you, we want to change the world.

#### How are you going to change the world?
One company, one product, one employee at a time.

We want people to understand that they can take their destiny in their hands. You have access to the world's knowledge. Everything you need to create and disrupt industries is at your fingertips. That's a super power and we want you to use it to create the products, companies and institutions of tomorrow. 

Think big. Be courageous. Courage is contagious. It takes as much energy to create something small than to create something big. It takes as much energy to create a tool that would be used by LeSoir than one that would be used by CNN, The New York Times and the BBC. Believe me. Done that, been there. 
 
So don't limit yourself by whatever distorted reality this society made you believe. Most of it is history. We are here to define the future.

You are not alone. People will help you in that journey. Because we all want change. 
We all want change because we are all tired of those meaningless artificial borders that we can't even see from space (that's why we connect with people on social media across borders), we are all tired of not being able to get access to some information based on our location (that's why we always find a way to share for the benefit of the community), we are all tired of having to send money using financial services that play with our money (so we use bitcoins), we are all tired of those old taxi services that take forever to pick you up (so we use Uber, Lyft or Djump). Things don't have to be that way. We can do better. We can change the world, one service, one industry at a time.

#### Where do we start? 
We start by building and training an army, an army of entrepreneurs. An army of people who are willing to fight the *status quo* to create new and better ways to do things. 

#### That's cool but not everybody is an entrepreneur
If you are not an entrepreneur, that's fine, but then join one. Go work for a young company, not for the incumbents.

#### What are your values?
Our values are the values of the Internet. We believe that information wants to be free. We believe in transparency. We believe that creating value is a non zero sum game. And we believe in empowering people to create. We are not meant to be passive consumers.

#### Do you have any affiliation with any political party or institution?
No. Having said that, we are open to work with any politician from any party who wants to promote entrepreneurship.
